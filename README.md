# Second-hand-car-price-prediction-
This project implements a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as model, horsepower, distance traveled, year of manufacture, fuel type, mileage, color, and safety features. The model utilizes both Random Forest and XGBoost regression algorithms to provide accurate price predictions.
